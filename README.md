==========
## Show Jenkins Build Status on your OSX menu bar.

Cengiz is an open source, MIT licensed small application which shows latest build status of a Jenkins repository on
your Mac's menu bar.

This application is written in about ~3 hours with absolute no planning so expect lots of ugly code and bugs.
I needed to watch my Jenkins repo closely and to make that easier I wrote this program. 

## Features
1. Click a build to open in browser.
2. Click preferences to enter project base url.
3. Live build status updates.
